METHODS
1.INTER_AREA
2.INTER_NEAREST
3.INTER_LINEAR
4.INTER-LINEAR-EXACT
5.INTER_CUBIC


<h3>1.INTER_AREA</h3>
INTER_AREA works better in image decimation and avoiding false inference patterns in images.
<h3>2. INTER_NEAREST
<h3>3. INTER_LINEAR
 INTER_NEAREST, this does the interpolation in two dimensions and predicts the function used to calculate the color of a pixel.
This algorithm is effective in handling visual distortions while zooming or enlarging an image.
<h3>4. INTER_LINEAR_EXACT
INTER_LINEAR_EXACT is a modification of INTER_LINEAR and both uses bilinear interpolation algorithm. The only difference is that the calculations in INTER_LINEAR_EXACT are accurate to a bit.
<h3>5. INTER_CUBIC
This option uses bicubic interpolation technique. This is an extension of cubic interpolation technique and is used for 2 dimension regular grid patterns.
RESULT â€“NOT GOOD
